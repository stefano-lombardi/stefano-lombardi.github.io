<!-- In the past I have been responsible for teaching PhD-level exercise sessions.
My responsibilities included preparing problem sets (both theoretical and in programming), solving them in class, and correcting and grading them.

In 2016 I took an internationally recognized [academic teacher training course](https://mp.uu.se/documents/432512/1088563/Course+information+Academic+Teacher+Training+Course-+ny+vt18.pdf/cb9bec63-bc17-b1a4-c17d-cc0ab9b26ca1) offered by Uppsala University.
