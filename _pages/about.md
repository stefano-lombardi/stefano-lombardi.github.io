<p style="margin-top:0.3cm;">Welcome!</p>

<p style="margin-top:0.3cm;">I am senior researcher at <a href="https://vatt.fi/en/frontpage">VATT</a> (Institute for Economic Research, Helsinki).
I currently hold an early-career grant from the Academy of Finland.</p>

<!--
My interests are in the field of labor and health economics. I study the effectiveness of social policies and the sources of inequality in society by using population registers and by developing and adopting causal inference methods. Part of my research studies the role of employers in determining income inequality. In this context, I am part of various international projects where I am PI for Sweden and Finland and that in some cases I co-lead. I am also interested in understanding the determinants of socioeconomic inequality by looking at how nature and nurture interact in shaping income and health differences over the lifetime.
