<p style="margin-top:0.3cm;">Welcome!</p>

<p style="margin-top:0.3cm;">I am senior researcher at <a href="https://vatt.fi/en/frontpage">VATT Institute for Economic Research</a> (Helsinki). 
</p>

<!--
<p style="margin-top:0.3cm;">My research interests are in Labour and Health economics. I use microeconometric methods and population-wide matched employer-employee data, health registers, and genetic data to study the production and persistence socioeconomic inequality. In much of my work I analyze the role of employers in determining income differences across workers, which I study in various international projects where I am PI for Finland and Sweden.

<!--I study the effectiveness of social policies and the sources of income and health inequality by using causal inference methods. -->
Much of my work in labor economics analyzes wage setting and the role of firms in shaping wage dispersion. I am also interested in understanding the determinants of socioeconomic inequality by looking at how nature and nurture interact in determining income and health differences over the life cycle.

My interests are in the field of labor and health economics. I study the effectiveness of social policies and the sources of inequality in society by using population registers and by developing and adopting causal inference methods. Part of my research studies the role of employers in determining income inequality. In this context, I am part of various international projects where I am PI for Sweden and Finland and that in some cases I co-lead. I am also interested in understanding the determinants of socioeconomic inequality by looking at how nature and nurture interact in shaping income and health differences over the lifetime.

<p style="margin-top:0.3cm;">Many of my projects are international collaborations where I am PI for Finland or Sweden, and since 2023 I have been part of <a href="https://www.oecd.org/en/about/projects/linkeed-200.html">LinkEED v2.0</a>, an OECD network that promotes the use of linked employer-employee data. <!--As part of LinkEED, I co-lead an academic project on job loss and the green transition and collaborate on several other policy and academic projects.-->
