Welcome!<br>
I am an economist with research interests in Labour and Health economics. 
I am also interested in how public policies affect firm behaviour and performance, and in dynamic treatment evaluation methods. <!-- and microsimulation techniques. --> 

I received my PhD in Economics from Uppsala University and [IFAU](https://www.ifau.se/en/) (Institute for Evaluation of Labor Market and Education Policy) in Autumn 2019.

I am affiliated to [IZA](https://www.iza.org/people/affiliates/21993/stefano-lombardi) (Institute of Labor Economics) and to [UCLS](https://ucls.nek.uu.se/about-the-center/) (Uppsala Center for Labor Studies).
I am external researcher at IFAU.

In 2020 I started a 3-year post-doc at [VATT](https://vatt.fi/en/frontpage) (Institute for Economic Research, Helsinki).
